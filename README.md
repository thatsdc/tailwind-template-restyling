This project is a **UI clone** of the [Spotlight Tailwind template](https://spotlight.tailwindui.com/) landing page, built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React Router**.  
It was created for **learning and practice purposes**, to replicate the layout, style, and responsiveness of the original website using modern front-end tools.
